# DjangoChatApplication

Starting this chat application project was my way of getting to know Django better. I wanted to 
understand how it works and what I could do with it, so I followed the official Django 
documentation closely. This project was an important first step for me, helping me build the skills I 
needed for bigger projects down the line.
